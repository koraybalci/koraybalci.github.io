title: How I built this site
---

This blog is using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to render markdown files I author to html and hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/). Simply put, I have a [GitHub public repo](https://github.com/koraybalci/koraybalci.github.io) where I put markdown formatted files like this one. Whenever I push them to GitHub, magic happens behind the scenes and markdowns are transformed to html. To make them pretty, I forked the [Poole/Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) repo. In total, building and publishing the site took around an hour or so.

Note that, I did NOT install Jekyll locally, since I am on Windows right now and pretty lazy. I just blindly edit files and push them to GitHub. I know it's not a healthy thing to push stuff without testing locally, but hey, this is just a blog site.

Here are the links that are still open in my browser:

* https://pages.github.com/
* http://jekyllrb.com/
* https://github.com/poole/lanyon
* http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/ (this is a nice starting point to use all the above.)
* https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now (another option like poole)

Next, I will add comments below posts, in case someone reads these and wants to comment... Here are the alternatives I found so far:

* Disqus: http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/
* Google+:  http://steelx.github.io/best-internet-tips/2014/11/23/Add-google-plus-comments-box-to-jekyll-website.html
* Discourse: http://eviltrout.com/2014/01/22/embedding-discourse.html

I suppose, I will go with Google+ for now, any recommendations are welcome in comments :)

I have to mention new text editor I use to author this site, the new toy/joy I found out. If you haven't already found out, I highly recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) by GitHub. I recently started using it and pretty content with it so far.
