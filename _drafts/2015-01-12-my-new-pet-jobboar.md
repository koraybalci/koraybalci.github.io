I believe every developer needs a pet project. Not a toy project by the way. Toys can be left aside when it is boring to play anymore, or when there is something shinier to toy with. Pets are different though. You cannot leave them for a long time. You need to love them, nurture them, play with them.

So, not exactly like a new year resolution, I must admit time of this pet project is sucpicious, I decided to start a personal pet project. My main motivation was to try out some new (shiny) technologies. Some I am already using, and some I wanted to teach myself. Here is an unordered listing:

* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) or [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com)
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org)
* [Typesctipt](http://www.typescriptlang.org)
* Unit testing and continuous integration

Apart from Yeoman/Grunt/Bower, I already have some experience with above stuff from previous projects. I have been using MS Visual Studio for almost forever now, and for some reason (hint: I am turning 40 in a few months!), I wanted a change. I started using [atom editor](http://atom.io) recently, and using Grunt and its friends seemed like a 1337 idea.

I will talk about more (and more) in later posts about tech stack.

So, what "is" the pet itself? Well, I was thinking about the problem of job search. There are several job search sites for job seekers, plus hundreds if not thousands of companies one might want to apply. I wish everyone the best luck to be accepted to the first position they apply, but it seems like the reality is you should be prepare to apply for hundreds! All job seeking advices on the web tell you that you should be well prepared and organized for the quest of landing a job. Here are some general tips

You should have;

* a list of companies and recruitment agencies that you are interested,
* a list of contact people (in charge of HR or recruitment process) in these places.
* a list of resumes and cover letters at least for each type of position if not for every unique application.
* notes about each application, sort of a diary to be able to "remember" the details of your correspondence.
* reminders to contact after a few days or a week after applying to keep the communication alive.

Feel free to add to the list in the comments...

Long story short, I think every job seeker needs a simple and flexible tool to track and organize for job hunting. I know I can use a spreadsheet, well almost every sort of software problems can be solved by Excel! So, as a pet project I decided to build a SaaS for job hunt tracking.

The first and most dreaded problem of every new project is to find a name for it. My standard rules (like everone else) is a name easy to remember, preferrably funny, short, and .com domain not taken. I'll keep the name search story short, after considering several names, speaking of hunting, I remembered I like boars. And luckily, [jobboar.com](http://jobboar.com) was available! Yay!

So, the name of my new pet is jobboar. It rhymes with a Turkish name Cabbar, which makes it easy for me to remember and use it daily (as a real pet name). AFAIK Cabbar means a man who does not cave in under difficulties, a fighter of some sort.

I will be experimenting SEO and lean things with the website though.
